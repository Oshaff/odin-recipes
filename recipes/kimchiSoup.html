<h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
        Kimchi existed as a non-spicy pickled vegetable dish well prior to the Joseon era; it was not until the introduction of chili peppers to the Korean peninsula mid-era that the variant of kimchi which has become the de facto standard of today was created. Kimchi jjigae is assumed to have developed around this time as well.

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups chopped kimchi</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½ pound pork belly, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) can fully cooked luncheon meat (such as SPAM®), cubed (Optional)</li>
        <li>¼ cup kochujang (Korean hot sauce) (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package silken tofu</li>
        <li>1 (3 ounce) package enoki mushrooms</li>
    </ul>
<h4>Steps</h4> 
    <ol>
        <li>Combine kimchi, water, sugar, and garlic in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil. Stir in pork belly, luncheon meat, and kochujang. Add tofu and mushrooms; stir carefully so you don't break up the tofu. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cook until kimchi is softened and pork is slightly pink in the center, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
